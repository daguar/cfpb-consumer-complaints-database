# CFPB Consumer Complaints Database

## A Place for Collaboration
This repo is meant to be a meeting ground, discussion forum, and code repository for folks working with the [consumer complaints database](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaintdatabase/) run by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ([@CFPB](https://github.com/cfpb)).

## How to Get Involved

* **Collaborative communication**: Use the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/daguar/cfpb-consumer-complaints-database/issues) section of this repo to collaborate by discussing ideas, problems, findings, and anything else related to working with the complaints database.

* **Code**: Contribute code that is helpful for working with the database (for example: cleaning, analysis, or API wrapping).

New to GitHub? No sweat. Accounts are free, and there's plenty of help around if you have questions.
